# Chinese-Checkers
Built a Chinese Checkers AI using model-free reinforcement learning (Q learning, SARSA learning).
Performed adversarial search algorithms (Alpha-Beta Pruning) to reduce the computing complexity.
Explored Deep Q Learning to approximate the value function and handle the massive state representations.
Designed four heuristic adversaries to avoid overfitting and the learning agent won the one adopting epsilon-greedy strategy in 9976/10000 cases.
